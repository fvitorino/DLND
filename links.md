# Training - Books, Lectures, Tutorials, etc

- [Grokking Deep Learning](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-deep-learning) by Andrew Trask. Use our exclusive discount code traskud17 for 40% off. This provides a very gentle introduction to Deep Learning and covers the intuition more than the theory.
- [Neural Networks And Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) by Michael Nielsen. This book is more rigorous than Grokking Deep Learning and includes a lot of fun, interactive visualizations to play with.
- [The Deep Learning Textbook](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) from Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. This online book has lot of material and is the most rigorous of the three books suggested.
- [Andrej Karpathy's CS231n Stanford course on Convolutional Neural Networks](http://cs231n.github.io)
